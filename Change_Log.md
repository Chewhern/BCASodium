# Version 0.0.1
1. Add ED448
2. Add X448

# Version 0.0.2
1. Add SM4 (China's Block Cipher which declassified in 2006)
2. Add SM3 (China's Hashing algorithm)

**Note specifically for version 0.0.2:\
My implementation may be unsafe, if you just code it on client
application should be fine. If you want to use it on something which's
online like on virtual private server, you are advised not to use it as
there'll be some unforeseen security issues and problems.**
